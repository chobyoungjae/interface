# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**배합일지 (Mixing Log)** - A project for recording and managing mixing/formulation data.

This is a newly initialized project. The codebase structure and architecture will be established as development progresses.

## Project Context

- **Language**: Korean (배합일지 = Mixing Log/Formulation Record)
- **Purpose**: Recording and managing mixing formulations and recipes
- **Status**: Initial development phase

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the following steps should be taken when beginning development:

1. Determine the technology stack based on PRD requirements
2. Initialize the appropriate project structure (e.g., `npm init`, `create-react-app`, etc.)
3. Set up version control best practices
4. Establish testing framework

## Key Files

- `PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document (currently template, needs completion)

## Notes for Implementation

When the PRD is completed and development begins:
- Consider the domain-specific terminology around mixing/formulation (배합)
- Ensure proper handling of Korean language content
- Focus on data accuracy for formulation records

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Current status: Clean, initial commit only
- Follow feature branch workflow once development begins
